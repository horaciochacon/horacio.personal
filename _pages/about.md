Hello, I'm Horacio Chacon-Torrico, a PhD student at the [Department of Health Metrics Sciences](https://depts.washington.edu/healthms/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/) (IHME) in the US Health Disparities team, where I work on small area estimation. My research interests include population health metrics, health data science, biomedical informatics, surveillance and health systems, small area estimation, and health inequalities, with a particular focus on the intersection of technology, data, and public health and how to better use data to measure health outcomes in middle- and low-income countries.

**Research Interests:**

I'm dedicated to finding solutions for global health that enable us to measure the health of people who are often ignored due to broad assumptions made about the health of a population. Through my work, I strive to develop data-driven solutions that promote health equity and address health disparities. For my master thesis I researched the drivers of spatial-temporal heterogeneity in COVID-19 outcomes in Peru with [Dr. Bobby Reiner](https://www.healthdata.org/about/bobby-reiner).

**Previously:**

Previously, I earned my Master's in Public Health (MPH) in Global Health from the Department of Global Health at the University of Washington. During my MPH, I worked as a Research Assistant at I-TECH, supporting the M&E data collection system from a Care and Treatment program in Zimbabwe. Additionally, I'm a peruvian physician and, besides my MPH, I hold M.Sc in Biomedical Informatics from [Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia](www.cayetano.edu.pe) where I worked designing a maternal and child health program that aided with a mHealth application for Community Health Workers and community-based components approach, aimed to monitor pregnant women and newborns in remote basin native communities
